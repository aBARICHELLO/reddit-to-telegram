# reddit-to-telegram

This script will watch the new content on a subreddit and post to a Telegram channel.

This fork is modified so that the bot posts one piece of content from the Hot session of the subreddit every hour at exactly 00 minutes.

TODO: Send image/gif directly instead of only the link.

## Config

* Create a `praw.ini` file:
```
[default]
client_id: <client id>
client_secret: <client secret>
username: <reddit user name>
password: <reddit user password>
```
* Set the following env vars:
  * `SUBREDDIT` - subreddit name
  * `TOKEN` - Telegram bot token
  * `CHANNEL` - Telegram chat name (the bot has to be added as Administrator)
  
* Run `python3 telegram_poster.py`

## Notes

The last sent submission id is being stored in `last_submission.id` file, so
if this file exists the bot will skip all submissions in the previous ones until 
this ID is found - or a new submission has been posted appears (this is determined 
by UTC timestamp of the submission and bot start time)
